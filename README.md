## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Troy Israel.  I have a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering.  My background is in Machine Learning, Embedded Systems and FPGA design.  Below are direct links to my project repos. 

This is a work in progress

## FPGA Projects: 
* [Sobel Edge Detector](https://github.com/troykerim/sobel_edge_detector) - Sobel Edge filter implemented on Zybo Z7-10 with VGA
* [Video Interface via VGA](https://github.com/troykerim/video_interface_with_zynq) - Sends images loaded on the Zybo to a VGA monitor
* [Dice Rolling Game](https://github.com/troykerim/zybo_dice_roller) - Dice Rolling game implemented on the Zybo Z7-10 
* [UART Module](https://github.com/troykerim/Uart_module) - Verilog Implementation of a UART module for both RX and TX
* [Pong Game](https://github.com/troykerim/pong_vga/tree/main) - Pong Game on VGA implemented on the Zybo Z7-10
