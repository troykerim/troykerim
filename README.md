## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Troy Israel.  I have a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering.  My background is in Machine Learning, Embedded Systems and FPGA design.  Below are direct links to my project repos. 

This is a work in progress

## FPGA Projects: 
* [Dice Rolling Game](https://github.com/troykerim/zybo_dice_roller) - Dice Rolling game implemented on the Zybo Z7-10 
* [UART Module](https://github.com/troykerim/Uart_module) - Verilog Implementation of a UART module for both RX and TX
* [Pong Game](https://github.com/troykerim/pong_vga/tree/main) - Pong Game on VGA implemented on the Zybo Z7-10

## Machine Learning Projects:
* [3D CNN Hyperspectral Image Classifier](https://github.com/troykerim/Image_Classification_with_spectral_data) - 3D CNN Model that classifies Hyperspectral Data into 6 distinct health metrics.
* [Minesweeper AI bot](https://github.com/FedeBailaque/Sweep_Savvy_Solver) - A bot that plays minesweeper.

### Hardware Tools
* Zybo Z7-10 FPGA
* STM32L476RG Nucleo Microcontroller
* Raspberry Pico
* Raspberry Pi
* Arduino
